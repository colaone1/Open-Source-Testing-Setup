# Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Weather App project, focusing on automated testing for performance, bugs, optimization, and code quality.

## Test Categories

### 1. Backend Tests (`tests/backend/`)
- API endpoint testing
- Data validation
- Error handling
- Database operations
- Authentication/Authorization

### 2. Frontend Tests (`tests/frontend/`)
- Component testing
- Integration testing
- User interface testing
- State management
- Event handling

### 3. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)
- Response time testing
- Load testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- Concurrent request handling
- Resource utilization

## Test Requirements

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All critical paths must be tested
- Edge cases must be covered
- Error scenarios must be tested

### Performance Requirements
- API response time < 500ms
- Concurrent request handling (10+ requests)
- Memory usage < 50MB under load
- CPU utilization < 70% under load

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests
```bash
npm run test:backend
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
npm run test:frontend
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated automatically and can be found in:
- `coverage/` - Code coverage reports
- `reports/performance/` - Performance test results
- `reports/junit/` - JUnit test reports

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull requests
- Merges to main branch
- Daily scheduled runs

## Best Practices

1. Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
2. Keep tests independent and isolated
3. Use meaningful test descriptions
4. Clean up test data after each test
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Test both success and failure scenarios

## Monitoring

Performance metrics are monitored using:
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource utilization
- User experience metrics

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Test timeouts - Increase timeout limits
2. Memory leaks - Check resource cleanup
3. Flaky tests - Ensure test isolation
4. Slow tests - Optimize test setup

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing test patterns
2. Update documentation
3. Ensure test coverage
4. Run all tests locally
